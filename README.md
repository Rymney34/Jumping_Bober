# Jumping_Bober

I just decide in mean time, to create a simple game using Java and JavaFX with SceneBuilder, yes I know its not the best for Games but that was my experiment.

All you need to do is follow this steps

1 - Download folder gameOnJava 

2 - Open it in IntelliJ Idea

3 - Press button play in HelloApplication 

(Game controlls - "A" = left, "D" = right, "SPACE" = jump)
